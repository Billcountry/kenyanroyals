# Kenyan Royals
>### Everyone deserves a place to call home

Kenyan Royals is a charity platform with one goal, to get at least one person off the streets every day.
Kenyan royals is not based on the idea of calling for exclusive fundraisers or looking for the well off alone to help.
Kenyan royals is looking for anyone with Ksh 10 to spare everyday or weekly or when you can.
Simply the same amount you use to buy sweets can be used to get someone off the streets. Here's how:
Wahenga walisema haba na haba hujaza kibaba(use google translate). If 1,000 of us was to contribute Ksh 10, that would be  Ksh 10,000 raised, the approximate amount needed by Pato to start a mtumba shoes business.
Pato is just an example and the first person that this project is going to focus on helping.
But there are many other's out there with different stories and reasons why they sleep outside or hungry.

We would all love a home to go to and that's what we aim to provide, but a home without a means to eat and pay for the home is not enough,
the aim of this project is to collect enough cash to get these people a house and a small business. This would enable them to stay standing when we help them app.
This is not the only concern as there are those who are disabled, we get them a wheel chair or another means that they need to work in our society,

These are some essentials that we only expect our politicians to do and very few are lucky to get such a favour, we seek to help as much people as we can and not by bankrupting ourselves.
All am asking is for each and everyone to contribute an amount that will never hurt your budget. Ksh 10 is just a recommendation, if you can do better, do it. 
We do not seek to help just one person so we don't recommend on you putting all your money on one person, please let's all contribute to help multiple individuals.
